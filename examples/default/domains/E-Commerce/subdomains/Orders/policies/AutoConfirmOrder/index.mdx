## Policy Rule

**Whenever** `PaymentComplete` is emitted,
**If** the order is pending and payment is completed,
**Then** dispatch `CreateShipment` command.

## Business Context

This policy automates the order fulfillment process by ensuring that once a payment is successfully completed, the order is immediately ready for shipping. This reduces manual intervention and speeds up the delivery process.

### Conditions

The policy evaluates the following conditions before dispatching the command:

1. **Order Status**: The order must be in a `pending` state
2. **Payment Status**: The payment must be `completed`
