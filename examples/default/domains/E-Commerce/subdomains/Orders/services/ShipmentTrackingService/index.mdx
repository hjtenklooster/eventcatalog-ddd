## Overview

The Shipment Tracking Service consumes `ShipmentCreated` events from the `cross-account-bus` to track shipments across the organization.

This service is used to test the entity channel chain visualization, where:
1. The **Shipment entity** sends `ShipmentCreated` to `shipping-domain-eventbus`
2. `shipping-domain-eventbus` routes to `cross-account-bus`
3. This service receives from `cross-account-bus`

The visualizer should show the full channel chain: `Shipment → ShipmentCreated → shipping-domain-eventbus → cross-account-bus → ShipmentTrackingService`
